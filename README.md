# Cyberdeck-OS
A Distraction Free Writing Coding Or Browsing OS for My Cozy Lil Cyberdeck
# The OS
Written on my hardware emulator, this will be a nice text-only bespoke kernal, inspired by the Apple Alphasmart, but with significantly greater memory, lower power consumption and text based optional internet connectivity (I don't like other distraction free writing environments because they have mandatory cloud storage subscription nonesense), also it will have USB support which seems small, but the alphasmart needs a printer port or firewire, so... that'll be a huge boon.

I have a pi zero w2 and a 2.13" b/w e ink display and some other hardware (USB hub; battery; mechanical keyboard),
which I need to emulate so I can rapidly develop a bare metal OS, for it.
ChatGPT will be helping me, so its a real blind leading the blind situation, wish me luck!

My design goals for this project are to get basic file browsing and text editing working, keyboard and usb-stick i/o, and then figure out how to test wifi connectivity, and lastly to port over the lynx web browser- which will likely defeat me, as that last one sounds hard, but I'm trying anyways, so neh.

This repository is part of a 3 repository project.
